# blackjack bot
This is a small and rather unintelligent program that will play blackjack. The way it works is by storing the deck as an ArrayList of all possible cards that could be drawn, then calculating the percentage change of busting on hit. There are also a few statements allowing for aces. I initially thought allowing for aces to be 1 or 11 would be extremely difficult given the chance of multiple aces, however i realised that if you have more than one ace, having both as 11 will cause you to bust, therefore I only need to check two scenarios; one where all aces are 1 and one where a single ace is worth 11 and all other aces are worth 1. This bot does not take into account other players' cards except to remove them from the pool of cards that could theoretically be drawn, nor does it heed the dealer's card.
